Blender Project #7: Tron: Legacy is one of my favorite movies of all time, so it was super fun to make Flynn's Lightcycle from the movie. I did take some creative liberty with the color of his light trail just because I thought it would look a bit more interesting with blue. Also, I'd like to eventually animate this but that will probably come at a later date.
