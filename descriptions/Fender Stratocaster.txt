Blender Project #9: I made a black and white Fender Stratocaster. This project took me quite a while to make because I would do some modeling and then learn more techniques (and so on and so on...); but I am so glad it is finally done. I wanted to make a detailed Stratocaster guitar that incorporated elements like the tiny ridges on the lower strings, smudges on the materials, and engraved chrome.
