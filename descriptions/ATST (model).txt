Blender Project #2a: I am so happy with the way this AT-ST looks! I was able to do this modeling and (super) basic material work without any tutorials and I just looked at reference photos online! I am going to leave it here for now because I want to learn more about adding some more complex materials to make it look 100x better; but in the future I want to come back and make a really nice scene for this.
